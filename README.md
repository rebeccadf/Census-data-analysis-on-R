# Census-data-analysis-on-R
Project that focuses on find the determinants of income using the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/gender-pay-gap-dataset. This project was carried on by me and my collegue Anna Badalyan for the course "Statistical learning" from the Master's degree in Data science at the university of Padova. First, we spent much time on cleaning the dataset and we tried to understand the intrinsic relation between some variables by performing some statistical tests and by visualizing them.  We applied the following statistical techinques using R: ANOVA, multiple regression, logistic regression, LDA and KNN.
